        quote: `Aaron is the engineer you want on your team when the problem is sparsely defined, the requirements are fluid and the solution should have been launched yesterday. He is unfazed by the challenges of a constantly changing business environment. He calmly and methodically works towards his deliverables and is able to quickly iterate on his solution as the problem space becomes clear with user data. He is able to interface easily with non-technical business units to gather requirements and solve their problems. He custom built many solutions when pre existing libraries were just not cutting it. He pushed the team to consider tools and methodologies that improved developer joy of working in our codebase. He kept a close eye on the performance metrics of all our products in the Growth team and took it upon himself to try various approaches to continually improve the baseline performance of our product. I look forward to working with him in the future.`,

      quote: `Aaron and I worked together on the Growth team at Wonolo from 2022-2023. His hallmark work included spearheading the development of a Netlify-deployed, CDN-hosted widget to help increase user sign-ups to the Wonolo mobile app across multiple user-facing sites, and standing up a newly branded company website using Next.js to replace Wonolo's WordPress site. From day one, he brought his solid experience, drive, and collaboration to the table, and helped our team become the engineering team to beat in terms of high-quality and speedy, tested output. Whether among the Growth team or with marketing, sales, and other engineering teams, Aaron was a tremendous team player. He's a personable, professional developer, and I'd be happy to work with him on future projects. Any engineering team would be fortunate to have him aboard!`,

      quote: `Aaron was an amazing mentor while I was in the midst of a web development bootcamp. He was an invaluable piece to my individual growth and understanding of material ranging from the basics with JavaScript's most vital operations, to React's concepts, and guiding me through complex problem solving and debugging processes. I can easily envision Aaron as a senior lead developer guiding both experienced and newer developers to create powerful, impactful projects. He clearly loves coding, as he mentored a few of us in the class, and continually showed off projects from new material he recently learned in his free time. Absolutely any team would become more effecient, productive, and reach a plethora of stretch goals once Aaron joins them.`,

      quote: `I have known Aaron for several years, and as I took my first steps into becoming a Full Stack Web Developer, I needed a solid mentor to guide me. Aaron has played that role and continues to be a trusted mentor. His talent for making complicated concepts understandable and patience created a great learning environment. He has spent countless hours teaching and guiding me through in-depth computer science concepts, HTML, CSS, React, and Typescript. He challenges me regularly to be resourceful in solving problems by pointing me in the correct direction but not giving me the answer. Aaron teaches me programming concepts and is an example of how to be a programmer with a high level of integrity. I could not be more thankful to have Aaron as my mentor and friend.`,

He seems to be quite comfortable working anywhere from frontend to backend, a true full stack engineer. He's very good at identifying good UI/UX patterns and creating user-facing features in a way that translates complex ideas into simple, user-friendly interfaces. As a peer, I love that he is very passionate about technology and is always happy to explain in detail any topic, whether related to our work or related to his interest in crypto-currency and block chain technology. I would love to have the opportunity to work with Aaron again.`,

      quote: `I was lucky to have Aaron as a mentor while learning software developement. He is an amazing teacher, and really helped me understand complex code. When I would get stuck on something, he did an awesome job at guiding me towards the correct answer without giving it to me too easily. This helped me get better at thinking through the logic of my code rather than just trying a bunch of things, which I tend to do as a new developer. Since he has so much experience in the industry, it was super beneficial to get some advice on industry standards, as well as career advice and insight on what I should be studying to improve my skillset. Aaron is a super nice guy and is really easy to get along with, which is almost as important as his programming abilities in my opinion, especially when you're working with him for hours at a time. I had a lot of late night coding sessions with Aaron, and I enjoyed every one.`,

He's extremely knowledgeable, can pull energy out of nowhere to inspire you, and really enjoys the act of mentoring. Aaron is a rarity, he's insightful, and he's an all-around fantastic human being. Thank you for all you do, Aaron!`,
